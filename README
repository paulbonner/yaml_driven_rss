RSS is easy if all the feeds that you need to deliver are based on a single table or a set of tables all conforming to the same structure. It becomes a little tricker when you need to query multiple data sources with signficantly diverse models.

yaml_driven_rss resolves that difficulty by providing support for delivering rss feeds based on definitions stored in a yaml configuration file. The YAML configuration provides the developer with the ability to specify data source, column set, sort order, selection criteria and post-processing code to be used to manipulate the resulting data. This lets you add and update feeds without making any changes to application code.

The example application demonstrates how to use this code. See config/feed_definitions.yml and lib/feed_definition.rb, and the test code in example/test to see how it all fits together.
